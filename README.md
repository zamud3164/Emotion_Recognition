# Emotion_Recognition
This project, emotion recognition using multimodal data, was done in the course ACIT4630, in spring 2024. 

### Dataset
IEMOCAP is used for this project. IEMOCAP can be downloaded by submitting a request using the official IEMOCAP webiste: https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/.
IEMOCAP will therefore not be provided here in this repo. However code for preprocessing the IEMOCAP dataset is provided along with the data after preprocessing is done. Therefore the step of preprocessing the data can be skipped, and the already processed data files can be used if IEMOCAP is not available for someone.

### Running the code
1. To run the code, first download all the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt
2.
